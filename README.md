# Advanced Programming Portfolio

This is a compilation of programs that I have created for my first assessment in Advanced Programming for Creative Computing using Python and the Tkinter module.

## Prerequisites

- Python (I use 3.12 but you might get away with 3.6 and up)
- Tkinter module (should already come with Python)

## Virtual Environment (optional)

I use a virtual environment to make sure there isn't any mismatch in modules or whatsoever. It's not a mandatory thing, but it is nice to set up.

```bash
# For Linux & Mac
python -m venv .venv        # Or `python3 -m venv .venv`
source .venv/bin/activate   # Activate

```
```pwsh
# For Windows
python -m venv .venv    # Create venv
.venv\Scripts\activate  # Activate
```

## Running the projects

The applications are separated into multiple scripts, but running the whole project should be as easy as running `gui.py`

```bash
# Make sure you're in the project's directory:
# cd [0X--project-name]
python gui.py   # Or `python3 gui.py`
```

Or if you're more used to doing it in VS Code:

1. Open `gui.py`.
2. Run it by clicking the "play" icon on the right side of the tab bar.
3. Enjoy.

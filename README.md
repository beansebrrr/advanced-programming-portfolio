# Advanced Programming Portfolio

This is a compilation of programs that I have created for my first assessment in Advanced Programming for Creative Computing.

## Prerequisites

- Python (I use 3.12 but you might get away with 3.6 and up)

## Virtual Environment (optional)

I use a virtual environment to make sure there isn't any mismatch in modules or whatsoever. It's not a mandatory thing, but it is nice to set up.

```bash
# For Linux & Mac
python -m venv .venv        # Or `python3 -m venv .venv`
source .venv/bin/activate   # Activate

```
```pwsh
# For Windows
python -m venv .venv    # Create venv
.venv\Scripts\activate  # Activate
```

## Running the projects

In each folder, I always name the main scripts `main.py`. You just need to run that one to see the whole thing. 

```bash
python main.py
```

And well, you know, running the scripts with VS Code works too.

# Math Quiz

This is a program that generates 10-item math quizzes. Built using Python with (hopefully) easy means to expand upon.

This project contains 3 files. `operations.py` contains all mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). `math_problem.py` contains logic for individual math problems and other underlying game logic. `gui.py` is the main script to run which opens a Tkinter window to start the project.

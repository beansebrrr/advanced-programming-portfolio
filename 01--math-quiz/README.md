# Math Quiz

This is a program that generates 10-item math quizzes. Built using Python with (hopefully) easy means to expand upon.

## Prerequisites

- Python (I use 3.12 but you might get away with 3.6 and up)

## Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)

```bash
# For Linux & Mac
python -m venv .venv        # Or `python3 -m venv .venv`
source .venv/bin/activate   # Activate

```
```pwsh
# For Windows
python -m venv .venv    # Create venv
.venv\Scripts\activate  # Activate
```

## Starting the quiz

It's as simple as running the script.

```bash
python main.py
```

Or, you know, running the script with VS Code works too.
